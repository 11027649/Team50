Heuristieken project november/december 2017
Protein Powder

Christian Bijvoets, David van Grinsven and Natasja Wezel

For this project we will make a program that folds a protein in it's most stable configuration. The program will take a protein string as user input. 

At first, we folded proteins made of only P (Proline) and H (Histidine). Prolines are polair and if they are next to eachother, this counts as -1 for stability.
